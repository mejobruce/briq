Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
Eclipse IDE (or any other Java IDE you prefer)
Selenium WebDriver (Java bindings)
JUnit library
A web driver executable (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver)
Step 2: Create a New Java Project
In your IDE (e.g., Eclipse), create a new Java project.

Step 3: Add External JARs
Add the Selenium WebDriver and JUnit libraries to your project by including their respective JAR files in your project's build path.

Step 4: Create a Test Class
Create a new Java class in your project to write your Selenium tests.let's create a class called BriqAutomation.

Step 5: Configure WebDriver
Make sure to configure your WebDriver appropriately. In the example above, we used ChromeDriver. Ensure you have downloaded the ChromeDriver executable and provide the correct path in System.setProperty.

Step 6: Run the Test
To run the test, right-click on your test class (MySeleniumTest in this case) in your IDE and select "Run as JUnit Test." This will execute your Selenium test.
